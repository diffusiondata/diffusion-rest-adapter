Diffusion REST Adapter
# REST to Streaming Adapter

`TODO: Rename the project`

## Configuration Model

The configuration model is made of two top level sections, Diffusion and Services.

### Diffusion

The Diffusion section describes the server to connect the client to.
It contains the `host`, `port`, `principal` and `password`. `TODO: More detail`

### Services

The Services section contains a list of services.

### Service

The Service describes a REST service to poll.
It contains the `host`, `port`, `pollPeriod`, `topicRoot` and `endpoints`. `TODO: More detail`

### Endpoint

The Endpoint describes an endpoint of a REST service to poll.
It contains the `name`, `url` and `topic`. `TODO: More detail`

## Filesystem configuration persistence

The configuration model consists of two files `service.json` and `service.version.json`. `TODO : Rename the config
files` The `service.version.json` file contains a single number that describes the version of the model. The
`service.json` file contains the configuration model serialised as JSON.

The files are parsed and generated by Jackson's JSON data binding features, all JSON processing is delegated to it.

## Topic management

An update source is registered for each service. When it becomes active a `JSON` topic will be created for each endpoint
of the service.

The client will request that the topics are removed with the session for each service.

## Polling

The client polls each endpoint at the rate configured for the service. When a response is received it is converted to a
`JSON` value and published to the Diffusion topic created for the endpoint.

## Reconfiguration

### Detecting reconfiguration

The client currently support polling a persisted model for changes. When a change is detected it will reconfigure to
use the new model.

### Applying reconfiguration

The client will establish a new session and set up the services and endpoints described in the new model. The session
configured to use the old model is then torn down.

The new session will be delayed by conflicting update source registrations. Requesting that the topics are removed with
the new session will prevent their removal when the old session closes.

## Building

### Running integration tests

The integration tests require a Diffusion server to run against. They are run by the profile, `integration-test`,
enabled when the environmental property `DIFFUSION_HOME` is set. They use the `diffusion-maven-plugin` to start up and
shutdown the the Diffusion server. The `diffusion-maven-plugin` requires a system dependency to run, these `systemPath`
for this dependency is relative to the `DIFFUSION_HOME` environmental variable. Any REST service is started embedded
within the JVM process.
